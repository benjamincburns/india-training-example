# Proof of prior art

This is a simple demonstration application used for training purposes.

It's a very minimalistic take on an intellectual property disclosure system which allows users to mint transferrable and nonfungible proof-of-existence tokens. Holding a PriorArtToken represents a claim of ownership over the intellectual property represented by the proof of existence hash for this token.

Tokens are minted with monotonic token IDs so that first disclosure can be identified in the event of a dispute over original inventorship.
